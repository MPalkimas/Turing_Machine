LAB 3 by MATTHEW PALKIMAS
TURING MACHINE EXECUTOR
:To run just compile lab3.cpp and use the format
a.out tmFile input
or
a.out tmFile -f (input text file)
:if you would like to see, I made a replica of your tm reader except it
works with file input as using tm does not. just compile tm_exact.cpp
